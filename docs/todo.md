# ToDo Implementation

## Images
- I've added images into src/assets/images/*
 - please add them to data, and maybe just migrate all images to data/ since I want all these images to be in the CMS
- Image for coach-will
 - add the image of coach-will to coach-will page
- Image for each core of core values
 - add the image of each core to each core value card
- display the logo in the header, footer and if you think it's good to do, in the hero of the landing page
