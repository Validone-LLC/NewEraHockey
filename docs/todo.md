## Completed
âœ… Stripe Checkout description formatting updated:
- Removed emoji icons
- Split into separate labeled fields:
  - Registration for Event: [event name]
  - Date: [full date]
  - Time: [time range]
  - Location: [address]
- Clear label: value structure for readability

Note: Bold formatting for labels is not supported in Stripe's plain text description field, but the clear structure makes labels easily distinguishable.
