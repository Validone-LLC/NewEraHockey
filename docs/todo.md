# ToDo Implementation

## Update coach page
- Update import for assets from assets/images/coach-will to the newly renamed directory /assets/images/coaches
- Add Dennis Nayandin coach, use dennis-n-coach.webp for image
- Summmary (please create the short one based on this, I'm just throwing out lines, so adjust the wording here and make it flow nicely):
 - Late hockey starter (age 14) but was able to train and learn quickly to play junior hockey at 18. Played at George Mason Univeristy (GMU) D3 NCAA Club for a semester then switched over to adult league and have been playing adult league since. Loves to help Coach will when the oppurtunity arises and loves to help teach. Russian parents, born in Michigan but moved to Virginia at an early age. Fun fact - friends with all the russian NHL players such as Ovechkin, Kuzynetzov, and Orlov. Shoots lefty. Is faster than Coach Will 
 - Maybe add a "Fun fact" section, since some coaches will be really empty, we can add this section. Coach Will can be left empty since his section is large.
