## Event Registration
- for event registration form, can we fix the icons for email and phone number inside of Parent/Guardian? When I autofill the input box becomes white, and the icons remain white, they should maybe turn black or one of the darker colors we have in the app
- for the phone number inputs, can we utilize the same format as in Contact Form, so: (555) 555-5555
- also the phone icon should be in the input for 'Emergency Contact' currently its not consisted across the form
