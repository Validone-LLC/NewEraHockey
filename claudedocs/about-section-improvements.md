# About Section Improvements

## Overview

Restructured the home page About Us section to create clearer information hierarchy and improve user experience.

## Problem Identified

**Original Issues**:
1. **Conflicting narratives**: Generic "About Us" content mixed with Coach Will-specific information
2. **Confusing CTA placement**: "Learn More About Coach Will" appeared before proper introduction
3. **Unclear hierarchy**: Not obvious whether focus was organization or individual coach
4. **Information flow**: Jumped between org description and coach credentials without clear transition

## Solution Implemented

### New Information Architecture

**Flow**: Organization → Credibility (Stats) → Leadership (Coach) → Context

**1. Organization Introduction** (Full-width, Centered)
- Title: "About New Era Hockey"
- Focus: What the organization stands for
- Content: Mission, values, approach
- Removed coach-specific references from org description

**2. Stats Section** (Grid)
- Kept existing 4-stat grid
- Provides social proof between org intro and coach section
- Natural credibility bridge

**3. Coach Section** (Two-Column Layout)
- **Section Title**: "Meet Your Head Coach"
- **Subheading**: "Will Pasko - Head Coach & Founder"
- **Left Column**:
  - Personal introduction
  - Coaching philosophy
  - Background and experience narrative
  - CTA: "View Full Coach Profile"
- **Right Column**:
  - Credentials box (existing style)
  - Certifications
  - Current coaching roles

**4. Additional Context** (Full-width, Centered)
- Kept existing content
- Ties organization and coach information together

## Files Modified

### `src/data/homeAbout.json`

**Before**:
```json
{
  "title": "About Us",
  "paragraphs": [...],  // Mixed org + coach content
  "cta": {...},         // CTA before coach intro
  "experience": {...}   // Coach credentials
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "organization": {
    "title": "About New Era Hockey",
    "paragraphs": [...]  // Pure org content
  },
  "coach": {
    "sectionTitle": "Meet Your Head Coach",
    "name": "Will Pasko",
    "title": "Head Coach & Founder",
    "intro": [...],      // Coach narrative
    "experience": {...}, // Credentials
    "cta": {...}         // CTA after intro
  },
  "additionalContext": "..."
}
```

## Content Improvements

### Organization Content
**Before**: "At New Era Hockey, we promise more than just your average private coach..."
**After**: "At New Era Hockey, we deliver an unparalleled training experience..."

**Change**: Removed coach-specific language, focused on organization identity

### Coach Content
**Added**:
- Personal founding story
- Coaching philosophy
- Clear credentials presentation
- Proper introduction before CTA

**Result**: Users now understand WHO Coach Will is before being asked to "learn more"

## Visual Hierarchy Improvements

**Before**:
```
About Us (org + coach mixed)    |    Coach Experience Box
           CTA "Learn More"      |
                Stats Grid
           Additional Context
```

**After**:
```
                About New Era Hockey (org only)
                    Stats Grid (proof)
    Meet Coach Will - Will Pasko (title)
Coach Intro + CTA    |    Credentials Box
                Additional Context
```

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Clear separation between organization and leadership
2. **Flow**: Logical progression from what → proof → who → engage
3. **Trust Building**: Organization credibility → Stats proof → Leader introduction
4. **CTA Context**: "View Full Profile" makes sense after meeting coach
5. **Scanability**: Easier to find specific information (org vs coach)

## Responsive Design

**Mobile (< 768px)**:
- Organization intro: Full-width, readable
- Stats: 2x2 grid
- Coach section: Stacked (intro → credentials)
- All content remains accessible

**Tablet (768px - 1024px)**:
- Stats: 4-column grid
- Coach section: Two-column when space allows

**Desktop (> 1024px)**:
- Full two-column coach layout
- Optimal reading width for org intro

## Animation Sequence

1. **Org Intro**: Fade-in from top (0.6s)
2. **Stats Grid**: Fade-in from bottom (0.6s)
3. **Coach Title**: Fade-in from top (0.6s)
4. **Coach Intro**: Slide-in from left (0.6s)
5. **Credentials**: Slide-in from right (0.6s)
6. **Certifications**: Stagger animation (0.1s delay each)
7. **Context**: Fade-in from bottom (0.6s + 0.2s delay)

**Result**: Smooth, sequential visual storytelling

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Data structure properly nested
- [x] All animations preserved
- [x] Responsive breakpoints working

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Coach Image**: Add photo to coach section for personal connection
2. **Video Introduction**: Embed short welcome video from Coach Will
3. **Player Testimonials**: Add quotes after coach section
4. **Interactive Stats**: Make stats clickable for more details
5. **Timeline**: Visual representation of Coach Will's journey

### CMS Integration
When implementing custom CMS:
- Keep organization/coach separation in data structure
- Allow easy editing of both org description and coach bio
- Support multiple coaches if business expands
- Enable coach profile linking to individual coach pages

## Summary

**Problem**: Mixed org/coach content with unclear hierarchy
**Solution**: Separated into logical sections with clear information flow
**Result**: Better UX, clearer messaging, more professional presentation

**Key Improvement**: Users now understand WHAT New Era Hockey is → See PROOF of success → Meet WHO leads it → Engage with COACH profile

The new structure positions the organization first while giving Coach Will proper introduction and context, making the CTA more meaningful and the entire section more effective for conversion.
