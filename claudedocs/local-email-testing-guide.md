# Local Email Testing Guide

## Best Practice: Test Locally with Stripe CLI

You **don't need to test on production** to verify emails. You can test the complete registration flow locally with real email delivery using the Stripe CLI.

## Setup: One-Time Configuration

### 1. Install Stripe CLI

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Using Scoop package manager
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe

# OR download from:
# https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
stripe --version
```

### 2. Login to Stripe CLI

```bash
stripe login
# This will open browser to authenticate with your Stripe account
# Choose your test/sandbox account
```

### 3. Forward Webhooks to Localhost

**Terminal 1 - Start Webhook Listener:**
```bash
cd P:/Repos/newerahockey

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook
```

**Output will show:**
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_1234567890abcdef... (^C to quit)
```

**Copy the webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### 4. Add Webhook Secret to .env

Create or update `.env` file in project root:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (SANDBOX KEYS)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...  # Your existing sandbox secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # From stripe listen output

# AWS SES Configuration (REAL - for email sending)
NEH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
NEH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
NEH_AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Email Configuration (REAL)
ADMIN_EMAIL=coachwill@newerahockeytraining.com
SES_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@newerahockeytraining.com
```

**Important:**
- ‚úÖ Use **sandbox** Stripe keys (`sk_test_...`)
- ‚úÖ Use **real** AWS SES credentials (to send actual emails)
- ‚úÖ Use **real** email addresses for testing

### 5. Start Netlify Dev Server

**Terminal 2 - Start Dev Server:**
```bash
cd P:/Repos/newerahockey
netlify dev
```

Server will start on `http://localhost:8888`

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Create Test Event in Google Calendar

```
Title: Email Test Camp
Description: Testing the complete email workflow.

Price: $10
Spots: 5

Location: Test Arena
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Local Site

Open browser: `http://localhost:8888/schedule`

### Step 3: Complete Registration

1. **Click "Register"** on your test event
2. **Fill out form** with **YOUR REAL EMAIL** as guardian email
3. **Submit** - redirects to Stripe Checkout
4. **Use Stripe test card:**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)
5. **Complete payment**

### Step 4: Watch Webhook Logs

**Terminal 1 (Stripe CLI)** will show:
```
[200] POST /stripe-webhook [evt_1ABC123...]
```

**Terminal 2 (Netlify Dev)** will show:
```
Processing checkout.session.completed: cs_test_...
Registration added for event 7p9uhqocns8fnaq3fgiums5gkk
Sending registration confirmation emails...
Admin notification sent. MessageId: 01000...
User confirmation sent to your@email.com. MessageId: 01000...
Registration confirmation emails sent successfully
```

### Step 5: Check Your Email

**Within 1-2 minutes**, you should receive:

1. **Guardian Confirmation Email**
   - Subject: "Registration Confirmed: Email Test Camp"
   - From: noreply@newerahockeytraining.com
   - Contains: Registration summary, next steps, contact info

2. **Admin should receive**
   - Subject: "New Registration: Email Test Camp"
   - From: noreply@newerahockeytraining.com
   - Contains: Full registration details, player info, emergency contact

3. **Stripe Receipt (separate)**
   - From: Stripe
   - Contains: Payment receipt

**Check spam folders** if emails don't appear in inbox.

## What's Being Tested

| Component | Environment | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Local (`localhost:8888`) | Registration form, UI |
| **Stripe Payment** | Sandbox (test mode) | No real charges |
| **Netlify Functions** | Local | Running via `netlify dev` |
| **Stripe Webhook** | Local (forwarded) | Stripe CLI forwards events |
| **Database** | Local Blob Storage | Netlify dev uses local storage |
| **AWS SES** | **PRODUCTION** | **Real emails sent** |
| **Email Recipients** | **REAL** | **Actual inboxes** |

## Sandbox vs Production Keys

### Stripe Keys

**Always use SANDBOX keys for testing:**

```bash
# Sandbox Keys (use these)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51...

# Production Keys (DO NOT use for testing)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51...  # ‚ùå Don't use locally
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51...  # ‚ùå Don't use locally
```

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Sandbox keys process test payments (no real charges)
- ‚úÖ Use test card numbers like `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- ‚úÖ Safe to test repeatedly without financial impact
- ‚ùå Production keys process REAL payments with REAL money

### AWS SES Credentials

**Always use REAL AWS SES credentials:**

```bash
# AWS SES (use REAL credentials even for testing)
NEH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
NEH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ AWS SES doesn't have "test mode" - it sends real emails
- ‚úÖ You want to verify emails are actually delivered
- ‚úÖ Same credentials work for dev and production

### Email Addresses

**Use REAL email addresses for testing:**

```bash
# Email Configuration (REAL addresses)
ADMIN_EMAIL=coachwill@newerahockeytraining.com
SES_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@newerahockeytraining.com

# Guardian email in form: Use YOUR real email
```

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Verifies emails are delivered successfully
- ‚úÖ Allows you to see the actual email content
- ‚úÖ Checks spam filter handling

## Testing on Production (NOT Recommended for Email Testing)

**If you absolutely must test on production:**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WRONG Approach (Don't Do This)
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: Using sandbox keys on production
# This would break production for real users!
# Real users couldn't make real payments
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Approach (If Production Testing Required)

1. **Use production keys** (already configured in Netlify)
2. **Test with real payment** (then refund immediately)
3. **Or use test mode in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Can trigger test events manually

**But this is unnecessary** - local testing with Stripe CLI is better!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stripe CLI Says "Command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# Windows: Use Scoop or download from GitHub
# Mac: brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
# Linux: Download from GitHub releases
```

### Issue: Webhook Secret Invalid

**Symptoms:**
```
Webhook signature verification failed
```

**Solution:**
1. Copy webhook secret from `stripe listen` output
2. Update `.env` with correct `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Restart `netlify dev`

### Issue: No Emails Received

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ AWS SES credentials in `.env` are correct
2. ‚úÖ `ADMIN_EMAIL` is set correctly
3. ‚úÖ Webhook fired successfully (check Terminal 1)
4. ‚úÖ Email logs show "sent successfully" (Terminal 2)
5. ‚úÖ Check spam folders
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è AWS SES sandbox mode limits (see below)

### Issue: AWS SES Sandbox Restrictions

**Symptoms:**
- Admin email works (verified email)
- Guardian email fails (unverified email)

**Why:**
AWS SES starts in "sandbox mode" which only allows sending to:
- Verified email addresses
- Verified domains

**Solution:**
```
Option 1: Verify your test email in AWS SES console
1. AWS SES Console ‚Üí Verified identities
2. Create identity ‚Üí Email address
3. Enter your test email
4. Click verification link sent to that email

Option 2: Request production access
1. AWS SES Console ‚Üí Account dashboard
2. Click "Request production access"
3. Fill out form (usually approved within 24 hours)
4. After approved, can send to any email address
```

### Issue: Registration Not Showing in Blob Storage

**Expected:**
Local testing uses local blob storage, not production database.

**To check local registrations:**
```bash
# Local blob storage location
# Check Netlify dev terminal for storage path
```
