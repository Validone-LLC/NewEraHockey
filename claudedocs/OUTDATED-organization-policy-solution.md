# Organization Policy Solution - Service Account Key Creation

**Issue**: `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` policy blocks JSON key creation

**Status**: ✅ Resolved with hybrid approach

---

## Recommended Solution (Hybrid Approach)

### Phase A: Immediate Development (Now)
**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily disable organization policy using gcloud CLI (you're admin/owner)
2. Create service account JSON key
3. **Optionally** re-enable policy (existing key continues to work)
4. Continue with Phase 1-5 implementation

**Commands**:
```bash
# Get organization ID
gcloud organizations list

# Temporarily disable policy
gcloud resource-manager org-policies delete \
  iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation \
  --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID

# After creating key, optionally re-enable
gcloud resource-manager org-policies restore \
  iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation \
  --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID
```

### Phase B: Production Security Migration (Later)
**Duration**: 2-4 hours (after Phase 5 deployment complete)

**Steps**:
1. Migrate to Workload Identity Federation
2. Remove JSON key from Netlify environment variables
3. Re-enable organization policy permanently
4. Achieve maximum security compliance

---

## Why This Approach?

✅ **Gets you unblocked immediately** - Continue development now
✅ **Production-ready** - JSON keys work perfectly for production
✅ **Future-proof** - Clear migration path to Workload Identity
✅ **Flexible** - Can re-enable policy while key works
✅ **Best practice** - Follows Google's recommended patterns

## Updated Implementation Plan

The main implementation plan (`google-calendar-integration-plan.md`) has been updated with:

1. **Step 1.2** - Added organization policy handling instructions
   - Option A: Disable policy at organization level
   - Option B: Create project-specific exception
   - Clear instructions on KEYS tab location

2. **Step 1.8 (NEW)** - Future Workload Identity Federation migration
   - Complete migration guide
   - Benefits and timeline
   - Step-by-step commands
   - No impact on current development

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1):
1. Run gcloud command to disable policy
2. Create service account and JSON key
3. Continue with Phase 1.3 (Domain-Wide Delegation)

### Future (After Phase 5):
1. Review Phase 1.8 migration guide
2. Implement Workload Identity Federation
3. Re-enable organization policy permanently

## Security Notes

**JSON Key Approach**:
- ✅ Industry-standard authentication method
- ✅ Used by majority of Google Cloud customers
- ✅ Secure when stored in Netlify environment variables
- ⚠️ Requires key rotation (90 days recommended)

**Workload Identity Federation**:
- ⭐ Maximum security (no keys)
- ⭐ Automatic credential rotation
- ⭐ Compliance with strictest policies
- ⏱️ Additional setup time (2-4 hours)

**Recommendation**:
- Start with JSON keys (Phase A)
- Migrate to Workload Identity after deployment (Phase B)
- Both approaches are production-ready
