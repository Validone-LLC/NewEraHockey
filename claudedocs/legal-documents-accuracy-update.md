# Legal Documents Accuracy Update - Terms & Privacy Policy

## Implementation Date
October 15, 2025

## Overview
Updated Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions to accurately reflect actual website functionality, removing irrelevant sections about payment processing and correcting data collection statements.

## Context

### Problem Statement
Both legal documents contained references to features that don't exist on the website:
- Payment processing through the website
- Collection of mailing/billing addresses
- Online registration system with payment integration
- PCI-compliant payment processors

- **Contact form**: Collects name, email, phone, message
- **Event registration**: "Coming Soon" placeholder, will collect name, email, phone only

## Sections Intentionally Kept

### Privacy Policy - Data Retention

**Kept As-Is**:
```
Financial records are retained in accordance with applicable tax and accounting regulations.
```

**Rationale**: While the website doesn't process payments, New Era Hockey as a business maintains financial records from external payment methods (Venmo, cash, etc.). This statement applies to business operations, not website data collection, and remains accurate.
