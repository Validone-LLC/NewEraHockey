# Troubleshooting Results - Contact Form 500 Error

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Double NEH Prefix in Local `.env` ✅ FIXED
**Location**: `.env` file
**Problem**: Environment variables had double `NEH_` prefix
```
❌ NEH_NEH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
❌ NEH_NEH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
❌ NEH_NEH_AWS_REGION
```

**Fixed to**:
```
✅ NEH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
✅ NEH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
✅ NEH_AWS_REGION
```

### Issue 2: Truncated Email in Netlify Production ⚠️ REQUIRES ACTION
**Location**: Netlify Dashboard → Environment variables
**Problem**: Production ADMIN_EMAIL value is truncated

**Current values**:
- ❌ Production: `andin@validone-llc.com` (missing "dn" prefix)
- ✅ Deploy Previews: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`
- ✅ Branch deploys: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`
- ✅ All other contexts: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`

**Required fix**:
Edit Production value to: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`

## Root Cause

The contact form fails in production because:
1. `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable in Production context has truncated value
2. AWS SES may reject the malformed/unverified email address
3. Code validation (lines 45-49 in contact.js) throws error if email is undefined/invalid

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Netlify Production Environment Variable
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select site: newerahockey
3. Navigate to: **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
4. Click on `ADMIN_EMAIL` variable
5. Edit **Production** deploy context value
6. Change from: `andin@validone-llc.com`
7. Change to: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`
8. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Email in AWS SES (If Needed)
If AWS SES account is in **Sandbox mode**, verify the admin email:

1. Go to [AWS SES Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses)
2. Navigate to **Verified identities**
3. Check if `dnayandin@validone-llc.com` is verified
4. If NOT verified:
   - Click **Create identity**
   - Select **Email address**
   - Enter: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`
   - Click **Create identity**
   - Check your email inbox for verification email from AWS
   - Click verification link
   - Confirm status shows "Verified" in AWS Console

### Step 3: Verify Other Netlify Environment Variables
Ensure these are also set correctly in Netlify Production:

- ✅ `NEH_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
- ✅ `NEH_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
- ✅ `NEH_AWS_REGION` - `us-east-1`
- ✅ `SES_FROM_EMAIL` - `no-reply@newerahockeytraining.com`
- ⚠️ `ADMIN_EMAIL` - **FIX TO**: `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`

### Step 4: Redeploy Site
1. Netlify Dashboard → **Deploys**
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 5: Test Contact Form
1. Visit: https://newerahockeytraining.com/contact
2. Fill out contact form with test data
3. Submit form
4. Expected results:
   - ✅ Form submits successfully
   - ✅ User receives confirmation email
   - ✅ Admin receives notification at `dnayandin@validone-llc.com`

## Verification

### Check Netlify Function Logs
After redeployment and testing:
1. Netlify Dashboard → **Functions** → `contact`
2. View recent invocations
3. Look for success logs:
   ```
   Sending admin notification to: dnayandin@validone-llc.com
   Sending emails via AWS SES...
   Admin email sent successfully. MessageId: <message-id>
   User confirmation sent successfully. MessageId: <message-id>
   Email saved: 2025-10-15-test-user-1234567890.json
   ```

### If Still Not Receiving Admin Emails
1. **Check spam/junk folder** in your email client
2. **Verify AWS SES status**: Ensure not in Sandbox mode OR email is verified
3. **Check AWS SES sending statistics**: AWS Console → SES → Account dashboard
4. **Review Netlify Function logs** for actual send confirmation with MessageIds

## Local Development Testing

Local `.env` file has been fixed. To test locally:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test contact form at http://localhost:5173/contact
```

Expected behavior:
- Form validation works (phone formatting, required fields)
- Successful submission triggers AWS SES email send
- Email record saved to `src/data/emails/`

## Summary

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Local `.env` file double NEH prefix issue

**Requires Your Action**:
- ⚠️ Fix Netlify Production `ADMIN_EMAIL` value (currently truncated)
- ⚠️ Verify `dnayandin@validone-llc.com` in AWS SES Console (if in Sandbox)
- ⚠️ Redeploy site after fixing environment variable

**Expected Timeline**:
- Fix Netlify variable: 2 minutes
- Verify AWS SES email: 5 minutes (includes waiting for verification email)
- Redeploy + test: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~12 minutes to full resolution
