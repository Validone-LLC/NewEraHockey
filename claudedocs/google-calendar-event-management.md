## Overview

The New Era Hockey website automatically syncs events from Coach Will's Google Calendar (`coachwill@newerahockeytraining.com`) and displays them on the **Training Schedule** page at `/schedule`.

Events are automatically categorized as either **Camps** or **Lessons** based on how you create them in Google Calendar.

---

## Event Categories

| Category | Description | Display |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Camps** | Multi-day training camps, clinics, or intensive programs | Shown when "Camps" toggle is active |
| **Lessons** | Individual or group training sessions | Shown when "Lessons" toggle is active |
| **Other** | Events that don't match either category | Not displayed on website |

---

## Method 1: Using Event Colors (Recommended)

The most reliable way to categorize events is by setting the **event color** in Google Calendar.

### Creating a Camp Event

1. **Open Google Calendar**
   - Go to: https://calendar.google.com
   - Make sure you're logged in as `coachwill@newerahockeytraining.com`

2. **Create New Event**
   - Click on a date/time slot OR click the **+ Create** button
   - Enter event details:
     - **Event title**: e.g., "Summer Hockey Camp 2025"
     - **Date and time**: Set start and end dates/times
     - **Location**: Add training facility address
     - **Description**: Add camp details, pricing, registration info

3. **Set Event Color to RED**
   - Click the **event color** dropdown (looks like a paint palette)
   - Select **Red** (color ID 11)
   - This automatically categorizes the event as a **Camp**

4. **Save Event**
   - Click **Save**
   - Event will appear on website under "Camps" toggle

### Creating a Lesson Event

1. **Open Google Calendar**
   - Go to: https://calendar.google.com
   - Make sure you're logged in as `coachwill@newerahockeytraining.com`

2. **Create New Event**
   - Click on a date/time slot OR click the **+ Create** button
   - Enter event details:
     - **Event title**: e.g., "Private Skating Lesson - John Smith"
     - **Date and time**: Set start and end times
     - **Location**: Add training facility address
     - **Description**: Add lesson details, client notes

3. **Set Event Color to BLUE**
   - Click the **event color** dropdown
   - Select **Blue** (color ID 9)
   - This automatically categorizes the event as a **Lesson**

4. **Save Event**
   - Click **Save**
   - Event will appear on website under "Lessons" toggle

---

## Method 2: Using Keywords in Title

If you **don't set an event color**, the system will automatically detect the category based on keywords in the event title.

### Automatic Camp Detection

Events with these keywords in the title are automatically categorized as **Camps**:
- "camp"
- Example titles:
  - "Summer Hockey Camp"
  - "Hockey Camp - Week 1"
  - "Goalie Camp"

### Automatic Lesson Detection

Events with these keywords in the title are automatically categorized as **Lessons**:
- "lesson"
- "training"
- Example titles:
  - "Private Lesson - Sarah Johnson"
  - "Group Training Session"
  - "Hockey Skills Training"

### Important Notes

- Keywords are **case-insensitive** ("Lesson", "lesson", "LESSON" all work)
- If an event has **no color** AND **no keywords**, it will **not appear** on the website
- Color-based categorization **takes priority** over keywords

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's

1. **Use Event Colors** (most reliable)
   - Red = Camps
   - Blue = Lessons

2. **Include Clear Titles**
   - Good: "Summer Hockey Camp 2025"
   - Good: "Private Lesson - Client Name"
   - Bad: "Event 1" (unclear)

3. **Add Detailed Descriptions**
   - Include pricing information
   - Add registration links
   - Specify skill levels or age groups
   - Add contact information

4. **Set Correct Date/Time**
   - Use appropriate time zones
   - For multi-day camps, create a single event with start/end dates
   - For recurring lessons, use Google Calendar's "Repeat" feature

5. **Add Location**
   - Include full facility address
   - Add rink name if applicable

### ‚ùå Don'ts

1. **Don't Use Random Colors**
   - Only Red (Camps) and Blue (Lessons) are recognized
   - Other colors require keywords in title

2. **Don't Create Hidden Events**
   - Events without color AND without keywords won't appear on website
   - Always verify events appear on `/schedule` page

3. **Don't Forget Time Zones**
   - Ensure events are in correct timezone (Eastern Time)
   - Check daylight saving time adjustments

4. **Don't Use Abbreviations in Titles**
   - Spell out "Lesson" instead of "Lsn"
   - Spell out "Camp" instead of "Cmp"

## Advanced: Understanding Event Categorization

The system uses a **3-tier fallback** to categorize events:

### Priority 1: Extended Properties (Hidden - Not Used Currently)
Reserved for future advanced categorization features.

### Priority 2: Event Colors (Recommended)
- **Red** (Color ID 11) ‚Üí **Camp**
- **Blue** (Color ID 9) ‚Üí **Lesson**
- Other colors ‚Üí Fall through to Priority 3

### Priority 3: Title Keywords (Automatic Fallback)
- Title contains "**camp**" ‚Üí **Camp**
- Title contains "**lesson**" OR "**training**" ‚Üí **Lesson**
- No keywords ‚Üí **Not displayed**

**Example Decision Flow**:
```
Event: "Summer Camp"
Color: Red
‚Üí Result: CAMP (Color takes priority)

Event: "Summer Camp"
Color: Green (not recognized)
‚Üí Result: CAMP (Keyword "camp" detected)

Event: "Hockey Skills Training"
Color: None
‚Üí Result: LESSON (Keyword "training" detected)

Event: "Meeting with Client"
Color: None
‚Üí Result: NOT DISPLAYED (No color, no keywords)
```
