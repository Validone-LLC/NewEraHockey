    text: "My son has been training under Coach William for a couple of years now, and we couldn't be happier with the experience. Coach William consistently designs high-paced drills that emphasize technical skills, making each session enjoyable and challenging.\n\nAs a parent, I truly appreciate Coach William's commitment to providing constructive feedback. He effectively highlights areas of improvement while acknowledging and reinforcing what is already working well. This approach helps my son understand his strengths and weaknesses, enabling him to set goals for continuous growth. Additionally, Coach William's motivational and mentorship skills have had a profound impact on my son's development as an athlete.",

    text: "I have been working with Coach Will for just a little over 2 years ago. I found out about Will through a mutual friend when we both did a session with Coach one day. Coach's moto is if you can't skate you can't play, he is not wrong so Coach works on tons of skating drills and skating with a puck to learn both skills together.\n\nCoach means a lot to me because he has helped me with my hockey journey a lot and has been supporting me in all of my teams (Hockey Players of Color Movement, representing team Puerto Rico) and is always honest with me whether it's I didn't do the drill right or I need to push harder. On top of that during sessions we have fun but Coach is always pushing me to my limits and I appreciate that of him.",

    text: "Since my son started working with coach Will less than a year ago, he has made a tremendous amount of progress. He has gone from playing on the LA team 2 yrs ago to playing in the top AA team last year and to being invited to play in AAA summer tournaments in New England. I am so proud of him, and I know that this would not have been possible without coach Will's help.\n\nWill is a truly exceptional coach. Not only is he committed to the success of your players, but he is also deeply invested in their overall development. Coach Will teaches them not only the skills and techniques they need to succeed on the ice, but also the importance of teamwork, sportsmanship, and perseverance. You have created a positive and supportive environment where players can thrive. I am particularly impressed with coach Will's off-ice program. He put a lot of thought and effort into developing a program that complements his on-ice lessons. This has been a huge benefit to my son, as it has helped him to improve his strength, conditioning, and overall fitness.\n\nI am so grateful for the impact that coach Will has had on my son's life. Matt is a more confident and well-rounded player because of coach Will. I know that Matt will continue to benefit from his coaching for many years to come.",

    text: 'I met Will about 4 years ago when rinks began to open during covid, back then when he wasn\'t even "Coach Will". We met at an Ashburn Stick n Puck and just began to pass the puck with each other and flowing on the ice. After I got off the ice I asked him if he would coach me, and here we are about 4 years later. Coach Will has seen me play at every level I have made, supporting me, counseling me, and helping me grow in every possible way. He would always be there and has made me better every time we have been on the ice, and there have been hundreds of times. I would not trade these last 4 years for anything, I know Coach Will is going to continue being there for me, and has helped me make a junior team in Florida called the Bold City Battalion as a 15 year old. I have much to improve on and I know Coach Will is going to be there for me, he has always made me strive to do my very best and he demands effort in every stride, and he has helped me beyond hockey and I am so grateful to have met him.',

    text: "Our son Ashton Kramer (USPHL Bold City Batallion, Junior Elite), first met Coach William during the beginnings of Covid when DMV rinks were shutting down. In search of thinning ice as a function of temporary rink closures, Ash found that Ashburn Ice House was the last rink to close and thus, talked us into daily drives to Ashburn although we lived in DC. During one of the back-to-back stick-and-puck sessions, Ashton (then 11 years old) was woking on his slap shot (which Coach William would admit wasn't so great at the time,) and approached to offer some pointers. Then, they started moving the puck and William began feeding pucks for Ash to rip on goal. It became abundantly clear in short order, that Ashton was soaking up William's advice like a dry sponge.\n\nAs I observed from the glass, I sensed a tremendous and overwhelming feeling of passion that is William, and I saw how Ashton was beaming with excitement and putting into play the tweaks and adjustments that William demonstrated. After they came off, I approached William to introduce myself and express my appreciation for spending so much time with Ashton. Then, I asked if he was a coach and he humbly responded that he simply loved the game and upon his observing Ashton's shared passion—he merely wanted to seize the opportunity to help him and make him a better player. Doubling down, I flat-out asked William if he would be willing to coach our son. Flattered although mildly surprised—William agreed. Thus, New Era Hockey was born.\n\nNearly 4 years later, Ashton developed from a stick-n-puck regular, single-A player, to AA bantam, earning a Varsity Roster spot as a Freshman last year at Bullis, and most recently an invitation to work out with the newest expansion USPHL team—Bold City Batallion. Ashton showed up and performed at Bold Camp—and he was completely blown away when he was offered a rostered spot as Bold's only 15 year old (and one of only a few in the nation-wide USPHL). But, do you know who else showed up? Coach William. He literally drove 750 miles to watch Ashton, his first student, take the ice among elite 16-20 year old young men from around the country.\n\nIn addition to hundreds of hours on ice, refining edge-work, breaking down his stride, focusing on head-up stick/handling, William has travelled to dozens Ashton's games, spent countless hours reviewing film, spent countless hours breaking down every facet of his game, observing team practices, motivational talks ahead of taking game ice—and sometimes motivational talks after a disappointing game or tournament. Ashton considers William his \"big brother.\"\n\nWilliam shares so many gifts and perhaps most notable —is his ability to teach at any level of the game. Whether your kiddo is taking their first few steps on the ice or whether they're heading into their first competitive bantam season where contact becomes a concerning modality of the game, Coach William will guide your player to the New Era of Hockey. He will work with you and your player to set realistic and achievable goals and will push your player achieve their very best. He will teach your kids how to play the game effectively, how to protect themselves, how to hit, how to take a hit, how to score, how to be selfless, how to be effective with the puck and without the puck. He will teach you how to have fun, love the game, how to improve your hockey IQ, how to be a well-respected teammate as well as a better human being.\n\nWe are so grateful and proud of Coach William as New Era Hockey has caught fire! Thanks Coach Will!",
