He immediately found a common ground with the boys. William's coaching has enhanced their shooting and skating skills and provided additional support outside of regular practices. He accurately pinpointed areas for improvement and offered valuable practice tips for on and off-ice training. Overall, William's expertise and personalized approach have had a remarkable impact on my sons' development as hockey players. I cannot recommend him more highly.",
