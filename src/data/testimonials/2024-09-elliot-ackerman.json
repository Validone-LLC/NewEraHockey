  "text": "William has coached my son for the better part of a year, It has been transformative for him. he had a strong desire to play, but I didn't grow up playing hockey, so I didn't know how to coach him. William filled this gap immediately, guiding my son in every aspect of the game. He offers the perfect blend of discipline and kindness, incredible resourcefulness in finding opportunities for my son to grow as an athlete, by creating both on and off-ice programs to enhance his game. William records video of their practice sessions and even attends my son's games, to meticulously deconstruct his performance to enhance his game and to better tailor his next training. William's commitment is total.\n\nUnder William's tutelage, my son has gone from a child who couldn't ice skate one year ago to a boy who identifies as an ice hockey player, is playing in rec leagues around the city, and will be playing for his school's team in the fall. Once again, I cannot over emphasize the incredibly positive influence William has had on my son.",
