  "text": "I met Will about 4 years ago when rinks began to open during covid, back then when he wasn't even \"Coach Will\". We met at an Ashburn Stick n Puck and just began to pass the puck with each other and flowing on the ice. After I got off the ice I asked him if he would coach me, and here we are about 4 years later. Coach Will has seen me play at every level I have made, supporting me, counseling me, and helping me grow in every possible way. He would always be there and has made me better every time we have been on the ice, and there have been hundreds of times. I would not trade these last 4 years for anything, I know Coach Will is going to continue being there for me, and has helped me make a junior team in Florida called the Bold City Battalion as a 15 year old. I have much to improve on and I know Coach Will is going to be there for me, he has always made me strive to do my very best and he demands effort in every stride, and he has helped me beyond hockey and I am so grateful to have met him.",
