Coach's moto is if you can't skate you can't play, he is not wrong so Coach works on tons of skating drills and skating with a puck to learn both skills together.\n\nCoach means a lot to me because he has helped me with my hockey journey a lot and has been supporting me in all of my teams (Hockey Players of Color Movement, representing team Puerto Rico) and is always honest with me whether it's I didn't do the drill right or I need to push harder. On top of that during sessions we have fun but Coach is always pushing me to my limits and I appreciate that of him.",
