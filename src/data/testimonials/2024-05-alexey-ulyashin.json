He has gone from playing on the LA team 2 yrs ago to playing in the top AA team last year and to being invited to play in AAA summer tournaments in New England. I am so proud of him, and I know that this would not have been possible without coach Will's help.\n\nWill is a truly exceptional coach. Not only is he committed to the success of your players, but he is also deeply invested in their overall development. Coach Will teaches them not only the skills and techniques they need to succeed on the ice, but also the importance of teamwork, sportsmanship, and perseverance. You have created a positive and supportive environment where players can thrive. I am particularly impressed with coach Will's off-ice program. He put a lot of thought and effort into developing a program that complements his on-ice lessons. This has been a huge benefit to my son, as it has helped him to improve his strength, conditioning, and overall fitness.\n\nI am so grateful for the impact that coach Will has had on my son's life. Matt is a more confident and well-rounded player because of coach Will. I know that Matt will continue to benefit from his coaching for many years to come.",
